## Logic and Architecture

The TicTacToe game is built on a simple yet effective architecture:

1. **Game Board**: Represented as a 3x3 grid, storing the state of each cell (empty, X, or O).

2. **Player Input**: Captures user clicks on the game board and updates the game state accordingly.

3. **AI Logic**: Implements a minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the computer player, considering all possible future moves.

4. **Win Detection**: After each move, checks for winning combinations horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

5. **State Management**: Keeps track of the current player, game status (in progress, won, or draw), and updates the UI accordingly.

6. **Rendering**: Updates the game board display after each move, showing X's and O's in their respective positions.

This architecture ensures a smooth gaming experience while providing a challenging AI opponent for players to enjoy.
